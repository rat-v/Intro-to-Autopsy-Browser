## Creating a Case and Analyzing Files

After installing Autopsy, I create a random case where I will be
examining a hard disk image and then generating a report

I upload a sample practice image in E01 format to analyze

There is nothing on volumes 1 and 3. I notice a cool video named
"SVstunts.avi"

I can also click open the File Types branch on the left pane to have all
the media better organized than having to look through directories

Some more cool motorcycles and pictures of helmets are all that were
detected

I can also view deleted files which is very useful

## Generating a Report

I can quickly generate a report with Autopsy by bookmarking files of
interest then navigating to Tools -\> Generate Report.
